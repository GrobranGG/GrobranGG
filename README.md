# Welcome to my profile!  

ðŸ’¬ My name is Lev, I am 17 years old, and I live in Russia.  

Iâ€™m currently studying to become a **Project Manager**, but sometimes I share my **code** and **personal projects** here as well â€” so you can find a mix of things on my profile ðŸ™‚  

At the moment, I rarely add new projects, so most of what you see are my older works.  
__Rate my pinned repositories, I will be grateful!__
